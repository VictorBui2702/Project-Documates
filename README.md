# Project Brief: `Documates'

*Here, describe your project as concisely as possible, ideally in two sentences. One sentence to describe the idea, and one sentence to explain why it's remarkable.*

This website is a place to store compliant templates and contracts for all industries. This would be a central resource for anyone looking for any legal document.  


### Motivations + Problems

*Why is this project useful? Why were you interested in working on it? What hair-on-fire problems do you see?*

It was brought up when I was studying BA and could not find any source which provides all templates in the industry. From that, I realised the need, which could rise whenever people want to use legal templates of contracts or any documentations, but do not know where.


### Key Features and Technical Implementation Plan

*Here, list out the key parts that you'll have to build and challenges that you foresee. Give the most details on what you think is the most special to your app.*


* Filtering
    * Based on industries
    * Based on languages (English & Vietnamese)
    * React + API hooks for filtering/searching a list of people to date. 

* Mobile Friendly. Our audience has cell phones, so we create our app as a PWA. 
    * React-based PWA which works offline when possible.

* Reviews
